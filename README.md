Create an [Anki] deck with Kanji & Vocab from [KanjiDamage]

# Why?

I love the [Official KanjiDamage Anki Deck] (I went through it myself), but I
also wanted to learn the vocab that went with the Kanji. So I made this deck,
which includes cards for learning three things:

- Kanji meanings
- Kanji Onyomi
- Vocabulary (both Kunyomi and Jukugo)

(Note: I excluded radical cards from this deck, mainly so the cards could be
text-only.)

One reason I think KanjiDamage is awesome is the order that Kanji are presented.
This deck preserves that ordering, and builds on top of it: the Kanji and Onyomi
are in the KanjiDamage order, and the vocab terms are ordered so you only learn
them after you've learned all the Kanji they use.

Also, the three types of cards (meanings, Onyomi, and vocab) are spaced, so that
you should only learn the Onyomi of a Kanji after you've learned the meaning of
the Kanji, and you should only learn the vocab after you've learned the meaning
and Onyomi of all the Kanji in the word.

I'm just starting to use this deck myself, so feedback is welcome.
